Suppose i have a data matrix that contains 5 columns, and i also have a vector of same length. Know i want to compare vector with each column of data matrix to find with which columns the vector matches most, For this i tried spearman correlation from scipy library but i want to know is their any better way to compare and find the most correlated column with vector out of datamatrix.

But i want to know a better way to compare and find the most correlated features.

Any resource or reference will be helpful.

Thanks
